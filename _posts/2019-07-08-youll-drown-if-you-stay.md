This short story is by Alyssa Wong, a Nebula, Shirley Jackson, and World Fantasy Award-nominated author.

<b> *** Spoilers below *** </b>

The story follows Ellis, who appears to be a voodoo practitioner who has inherited his powers from his mother. The trouble starts after his uncle, a preacher man, follows Prince William to his town to revitalise the mine industry or something. Ellis is in love with Marisol, a normal girl who isn't afraid of him. Over the course of the story, Ellis comes into his power, dies, and sends Marisol off to seek her fortunes outside this town where she is a prostitute. Prince William appears to be some regular industrial forward-thinker who has made a deal with Ellis's uncle for similar powers to command the dead, and Samuel is his sidekick and super in love with him. Neither are particularly important. 

Not much really changes for Ellis in this story. At its open, he's a boy who smells like a corpse and runs off into the desert a lot; at its end, he's actually dead and has to stay around the desert. Marisol is a plot device. What really draws me into this story is that it's much more a testament to the power and personification of nature. Ellis and his mother *are* the desert, and they own all the creatures within -- to the extent of commanding their bones reanimate or lie in rest. By the end of the story, Ellis is ending the long drought that the town has suffered through with his rain lullaby; ending the drawn out death of the town and finally allowing new life.

This story reminded me of another story I read recently. I don't remember the name right now, but territories of lands were activated with 'grains' that took over whichever man or woman was unlucky enough to be chained to them as steward, never leaving. (Although the story had a distinctly matriarchal feel to it; the principal stewards were female). All other humans were forced to live a nomadic lifestyle. 

I liked that the story was narrated in a second-person point of view. That is uncommon, especially without being somewhat tacky; Ellis was a fleshed-out character that escaped this fate. It was also written in present tense; this particular combination is hard! I liked that the brothel madame, Lettie, clearly had some emotional backstory going on. 

It made me sad, but I think that was more because my partner Jakub is on a long flight to San Francisco far away from me and I overly identified with the Ellis/Marisol separation.
