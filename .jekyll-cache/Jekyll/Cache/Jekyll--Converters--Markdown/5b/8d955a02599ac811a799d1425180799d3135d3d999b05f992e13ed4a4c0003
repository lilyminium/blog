I"þ<p>Here is how to set up Ubuntu 19.04 on a computer to work, the first time.</p>

<h3 id="0-obtain-a-ubuntu-usb-drive">0. Obtain a Ubuntu USB drive</h3>
<p>You need to somehow create a bootable USB stick. This is easiest in Ubuntu and there are many tutorials already, so I wonâ€™t clutter it up.</p>

<h3 id="1-install-ubuntu-and-drivers">1. Install Ubuntu and drivers</h3>
<p>Stick the USB in and boot up the computer. You need to change the boot order to boot off the USB stick first. This differs across operating systems; on our old Ubuntu 16.04s, we hit F10 to bring up Boot Options.</p>

<p>You can choose a normal installation or a minimal one. Out of convenience, we go with the normal installation; the only weirdly irritating thing it installs is Amazon. This shouldnâ€™t take long â€“ ours was under 10 min.</p>

<p><strong>Do not reboot before Step 2.</strong></p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We found that if we rebooted our computer off the <em>default</em> installation, the displays wouldnâ€™t work. It turns out this is <em>probably</em> because of the buggy Wayland display server, but we didnâ€™t sit down to disentangle Wayland vs. Nvidia drivers (another common source of issues) vs. buggy video drivers as a whole.</p>

<p>You may like to install vim.</p>
