I"v<p>Here is how to set up Ubuntu 19.04 on a computer to work, the first time.</p>

<p>You need to somehow create a bootable USB stick. This is easiest in Ubuntu and there are many tutorials already, so I won’t clutter it up.</p>

<h3 id="1-install-ubuntu">1. Install Ubuntu</h3>
<p>Stick the USB in and boot up the computer. You need to change the boot order to boot off the USB stick first. This differs across operating systems; on our old Ubuntu 16.04s, we hit F10 to bring up Boot Options.</p>

<p>You can choose a normal installation or a minimal one. Out of convenience, we go with the normal installation; the only weirdly irritating thing it installs is Amazon. This shouldn’t take long – ours was under 10 min.</p>

<p><strong>Do not reboot before Step 2.</strong></p>
